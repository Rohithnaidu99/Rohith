            Please don't skip this 1-minute read. I'm sorry to interrupt, but our fundraiser won’t last long. This Sunday, 3 September, I humbly request you to reflect on the number of times you visited Wikipedia in the past year, the value you got from it, and whether you're able to contribute ₹ 25. If you can, kindly join the 2% of readers who donate. If everyone reading this right now gave ₹ 25, we'd reach our goal in a couple of hours.
